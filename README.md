# Sorting-Algorithms
A repository of sorting algorithms written in C++

<br>

## Getting Started
* Clone this repository
* Compile ```Main.cpp``` (g++ ```Main.cpp``` -o ```Main.exe```)
* Run ```Main.exe```

<br>

## How to Use
* Run ```Main.exe```
* Input the desired size of the array and the max possible value of any element in it
* Select one of the available sorting algorithms
* The program will generate an array of the input size containing random numbers and then sort it using the input algorithm

(Note: If you would like to use a specific algorithm, simply include the corresponding header file in your source code and call the function)
